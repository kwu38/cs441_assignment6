This app allows you to log what you eat over the course of a day. You can create
an account and your user info will be saved on a database. You can then add items
that you had eaten and it will keep track of all the foods you have eaten in the
database and also display it on the screen. I wanted to add extra features like 
having a prebuilt database including all different kinds of food and their nutritional
value, but that proved to be a little more complex than I thought. Might build
on top of this for the final project.
